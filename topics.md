* Session Title: Painless end to end testing with Cypress
* Preferred Timeframe: March - June
* Event Type: 30/50-min Lecture
* Summary:‚Ä®  I recently went to Assert.JS where I saw a demo for Cypress.io. I couldn‚Äôt believe this tool existed and I had never heard about it. I immediately realized all of the things I always wanted in e2e testing had already been done, including things I didn‚Äôt know I wanted. I‚Äôll demo what a cypress workflow looks like and show the cool tricks I‚Äôve learned to make testing easy.
